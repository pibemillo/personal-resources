# JavaScript Resources

### Videos

#### [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts]: paid web course
> Javascript is the language that modern developers need to know, and know well. Truly knowing Javascript will get you a job, and enable you to build quality web and server applications.

### Books

1. #### [Building Front-End Web Apps with Plain JavaScript]
    > This book shows how to build front-end web applications with plain JavaScript, not using any (third-party) framework or library. A front-end web application can be provided by any web server, but it is executed on the user's computer device (smartphone, tablet or notebook), and not on the remote web server. Typically, but not necessarily, a front-end web application is a single-user application, which is not shared with other users.

1. #### [DOM Enlightenment]: Exploring the relationship between JavaScript and the modern HTML DOM
    > This book is not an exhaustive reference on DOM scripting or JavaScript. It may, however, be the most exhaustive book written about DOM scripting without the use of a library/framework.

1. #### [Eloquent JavaScript]: This is a book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital.
    > This is a book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital. You can read it online here, or get your own paperback copy of the book.

1. #### [Human JavaScript]: Build powerfully simple browser apps.
    > You can read about JavaScript, the language, elsewhere. Its good parts, bad parts, and ugly parts are well documented.
    > This is a book about a specific set of tools, patterns, and approaches that we feel are optimized for people.
    > These approaches enable our team to quickly build and deliver high-quality JavaScript applications for humans.

1. #### [JavaScript Allongé]: A long pull of functions, combinators, & decorators
    > First, JavaScript Allongé gives you the tools to deal with JavaScript bugs, hitches, edge cases, and other potential pitfalls.
    > Second, JavaScript Allongé provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric.

1. #### [JavaScript Enlightenment]: A book to turn a JavaScript library user into a JavaScript developer
    > It was my intention to write a book to give the reader an accurate JavaScript worldview through an examination of native JavaScript objects and supporting nuances: complex values, primitive values, scope, inheritance, the head object, etc.

1. #### [JavaScript: The Good Parts]: pdf
    > My goal here is to help youto learn to think in JavaScript. I will show youthe components
of the language and start you on the process of discovering the ways those
components can be put together.

1. #### [The JavaScript Tutorial]
    > HTML5 is great. jQuery is cool. Node.JS is awesome. Base them on the solid, powerful basement of pure JavaScript and you can rock the web! ;)

1. #### [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns]
    > Design patterns also provide us a common vocabulary to describe solutions. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution in code form to others.
    > In this book we will explore applying both classical and modern design patterns to the JavaScript programming language.

1. #### [Programming JavaScript Applications]
    > This book exists for one purpose: to help you gain the knowledge you need to build complete JavaScript applications that are easy to extend and maintain.

1. #### [Single page apps in depth]: a.k.a Mixu's single page app book
    > It's not an API reference on a particular framework, rather, the focus is on discussing patterns, implementation choices and decent practices.
    > My ambition here is to decompose the problem of writing a web app, take a fresh look at it and hopefully make better decisions the next time you make one.

1. #### [Speaking JavaScript]: An In-Depth Guide for Programmers
    > Due to its prevalence on the Web and other factors, JavaScript has become hard to avoid. That doesn’t mean that it is well liked, though. With this book, I’m hoping to convince you that, while you do have to accept a fair amount of quirks when using it, JavaScript is a decent language that makes you very productive and can be fun to program in.
